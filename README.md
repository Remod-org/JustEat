# JustEat

If the user presses the USE key (e) when looking at a berry, bush, or potato, they will consume it instead of picking it up.

However, if defaultEat is false, the item will be picked up.

Regardless of the configuration, pressing SHIFT at the same time will reverse the configuration.

## Configuration
```json
{
  "defaultEat": true,
  "Version": {
    "Major": 1,
    "Minor": 0,
    "Patch": 1
  }
}
```
